      <h3>Timeseries of aggregated dictionaries</h1>
      <p>This demo uses sample code from a ContentMine-API dump to Zenodo and can be recreated with this <a href="https://github.com/ContentMine/visualizations/tree/master/dictionaries" target="_blank">source code</a>.</p>
      The raw data consists of a one-month data dump from the ContentMine-API, which can be downloaded <a href="https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.154505" target="_blank">from Zenodo</a>.
      It has been preprocessed and the features for each visualization have been extracted, see <a href="https://github.com/ContentMine/visualizations/blob/master/preprocessing/preprocessing.py" target="_blank">here</a> for the source code.
     </p>
     <p>The data consists of 473,563 individual facts extracted from 28,672 publications in the range of 1.-31. May 2016 (as indicated by first publication date by EuropePMC).
       Facts are extracted by matching the fulltext with our <a href="https://github.com/ContentMine/dictionaries" target="_blank">dictionaries</a>, a collection of controlled vocabularies of words interesting for a domain or a specific research question.
     </p>
     <p>The upper time series shows the absolute counts of facts, aggregated by their source dictionary. The lower time series shows the relative share of facts per dictionary, as a fraction of the daily total count.</p>
