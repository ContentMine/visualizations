      <h3>Timeseries of most frequent and uptrending facts</h1>
      <p>This demo uses sample code from a ContentMine-API dump to Zenodo and can be recreated with this <a href="https://github.com/ContentMine/visualizations/tree/master/trending" target="_blank">source code</a>.</p>
      The raw data consists of a one-month data dump from the ContentMine-API, which can be downloaded <a href="https://zenodo.org/record/61334#.V9F3B-1MdhF" target="_blank">from Zenodo</a>.
      It has been preprocessed and the features for each visualization have been extracted, see <a href="https://github.com/ContentMine/visualizations/blob/master/preprocessing/preprocessing.py" target="_blank">here</a> for the source code.
     </p>
     <p>The data consists of 473.563 individual facts extracted from 28.672 publications in the range of 1.-31. May 2016 (as indicated by first publication date by EuropePMC).
       Facts are extracted by matching the fulltext with our <a href="https://github.com/ContentMine/dictionaries" target="_blank">dictionaries</a>, a collection of controlled vocabularies of words interesting for a domain or a specific research question.
     </p>
     <p>The left column shows the top 10 facts, determined by absolute counts over the whole period. The right column shows the top 10 uptrending facts, determined by the sum of percentage changes of daily counts.</p>
