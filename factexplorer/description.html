      <h3>Timeseries of individual facts</h1>
      <p>This demo uses sample code from a ContentMine-API dump to Zenodo and can be recreated with this <a href="https://github.com/ContentMine/visualizations/tree/master/factexplorer" target="_blank">source code</a>.</p>
      The raw data consists of a dump from the ContentMine-API based on a query for "Zika" on EuropePMC, which can be downloaded <a href="https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.154505" target="_blank">from Zenodo</a>.
      It has been preprocessed and the features for each visualization have been extracted, see <a href="https://github.com/ContentMine/visualizations/blob/master/preprocessing/preprocessing.py" target="_blank">here</a> for the source code.
     </p>
     <p>The data consists of 34,039 individual facts extracted from 503 publications in the range of 2000 to 2016 (as indicated by first publication date by EuropePMC).
       Facts are extracted by matching the fulltext with our <a href="https://github.com/ContentMine/dictionaries" target="_blank">dictionaries</a>, a collection of controlled vocabularies of words interesting for a domain or a specific research question.
     </p>
     <p>The facts can be selected by user input. If no fact can be found, the graph will not change.</p>
