      <h3>Co-occurrence Heatmap of facts</h1>
      <p>This demo uses sample code from a ContentMine-API dump to Zenodo and can be
         recreated with this <a href="https://github.com/ContentMine/visualizations/tree/master/cooccurrences" target="_blank">source code</a>.
         The raw data consists of a one-month data dump from the ContentMine-API, which can be downloaded <a href="https://zenodo.org/record/61334#.V9F3B-1MdhF" target="_blank">from Zenodo</a>.
         It has been preprocessed and the features for each visualization have been extracted, see <a href="https://github.com/ContentMine/visualizations/blob/master/preprocessing/preprocessing.py" target="_blank">here</a> for the source code.
      </p>
      <p>The data consists of 473.563 individual facts extracted from 28.672 publications in the range of 1.-31. May 2016 (as indicated by first publication date by EuropePMC).
